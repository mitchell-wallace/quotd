Great start, but not quite there. The safe area isn't working at all in android studio; let's take another attempt at making this work through the proper safe area API when running in capacitor. Also, this download feature works more as a "Share" button; I'm hoping also for a traditional download option that works the same as downloading a file from a web browser, with no share dialog. Let's do this: for both web and mobile, we have both a download and a share button. For mobile, the current download-and-share flow should be the mobile part of handleShare, and a plain file download to the local downloads folder should be the mobile part of handleDownload. For web, the current download flow should be the same, and the web handleShare path should assemble a sharing link that encodes the image, font, font size, and words into url parameters, copies the link to clipboard, and temporarily transforms the share button with a "Copied to clipboard!" message, for maybe 5 seconds. If you think it makes sense, maybe handleShare/handleDownload then call separate handleWebShare and handleMobileShare etc functions to keep it a bit cleaner.
